# spygrapher
A spyware that takes a series of screenshots then it compress them and finally sends them via email. Software built for educational purpouses.

DISCLAIMER:
I don't encourge the use of this software as a privacy violation tool. As I already mentionate this is an educational proyect that im creating with the intention of learning how to interact with the OS and automate tasks using Python.

IMPORTANT:
Check the 4 lines under the # USER comment in the ### MAIN ### program before running the script!

When the script is executed 3 folders will be created, to store the screenshots, compressed screenshots and the images to be found.
On the find folder you need to put the images that the program will search on screen, this images needs to be in .png format and their names should not contain accents. Example names: my_image_1.png, another image231.png

Keep in mind that the resolution of the images affects the confidence of the search.
